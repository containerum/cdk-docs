# Frequently Asked Questions

##### **Q:** What is Kubernetes Distribution by Containerum?
Kubernetes Distribution by Containerum (KDC) is a production-ready upstream Kubernetes distro that has been tested by Containerum engineers. It is guaranteed to be compatible with any applications and to run on any cloud or on-premise. Containerum watches for changes in the official Kubernetes distribution and runs a series of tests for each release to deliver production-ready KDC as fast as possible.

##### **Q:** Is it free?
Sure, you can install and use KDC for free.

##### **Q:** What plugins should I use?
Kubernetes Distribution by Containerum is compatible with all Kubernetes plugins. However, we recommend using the plugins listed in the [plugins](/plugins/) section as they have been tested for stability and reliability.

##### **Q:** KDC is available as binaries and Docker images. Which one should I install?
Launching KDC from binaries ensures that Kubernetes is independent from your container runtime. However, it is perfectly fine to launch KDC from Docker images as you would do with the standard Kubernetes distribution.

##### **Q:** Can I get support?

**A:** Sure, Kubernetes Distribution by Containerum comes with support and maintenance plans. Prices are available [here](https://containerum.com/kubernetes/). You can [contact](https://containerum.com/sales/) Containerum for more information.
