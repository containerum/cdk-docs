# Frequently Asked Questions

##### **Q:** What is Containerum Distribution of Kubernetes?
Containerum Distribution of Kubernetes (CDK) is a production-ready upstream Kubernetes distro that has been tested by Containerum engineers. It is guaranteed to be compatible with any applications and to run on any cloud or on-premise. Containerum watches for changes in the official Kubernetes distribution and runs a series of tests for each release to deliver production-ready CDK as fast as possible.

##### **Q:** Is it free?
Sure, you can install and use CDK for free.

##### **Q:** What plugins should I use?
Containerum Distribution of Kubernetes is compatible with all Kubernetes plugins. However, we recommend using the plugins listed in the [plugins](/plugins/) section as they have been tested for stability and reliability.

##### **Q:** CDK is available as binaries and Docker images. Which one should I install?
Launching CDK from binaries ensures that Kubernetes is independent from your container runtime. However, it is perfectly fine to launch CDK from Docker images as you would do with the standard Kubernetes distribution.
