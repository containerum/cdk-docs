# Containerum Kubernetes Package
This section describes how to bootstrap a high availability cluster with Containerum Kubernetes Package.
Containerum Kubernetes Package is a production-grade upstream Kubernetes distribution. It has been tested and is guaranteed to work on any infrastructure. Our Kubernetes package relies on containerd runtime. Containerd installation is also covered in this guide.

Currently it is possible to bootstrap a cluster from binaries only. Make sure that your VMs meet the [requirements](/kubernetes/prerequirements) and then proceed to [installation instructions](/kubernetes/installation/).
